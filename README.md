# 幽玄
A "book" on Japanese.

Because just "taking notes" is for people who don't _actually_ learn languages.

More to come...

## Table of Contents
Units 0, 1, and 3 are omitted. I started this after completing some (basic) study, and left out several incidentals and fundamental concepts, such as です, ます and ました forms, etc.

The first few units will be a little "inconsistent", in that they'll use certain constructions in examples that haven't yet been presented. It'll even out by Unit 6 or so, but any "extras" should be pretty easy to pick up independently (...a habit you'll need anyway, if you're at all serious about Japanese).)

### Unit 3
Unit 3 introduces the て-form of a verb, and some of its primary uses:

#### て-form
We begin with an overview of how to form the て-form, then explore the following applications.

- -てください as "please do..."

> Please read this manga by tomorrow.
> 明日までにこの漫画を読んでください。

- -て as linking verb, meaning "and"

> I went to the restaurant and ate dinner.
> レストランに行って、晩御飯を食べました。

- -ていただけませんか as politer -てください

> Please go to the supermarket tomorrow.
> 明日スーパーに行きてください。

- -ても as "even if..."

> Even if I work, I won't have money.
> 仕事をしても、お金がありません。


#### Ways to Say "Which"
Next, we explore ways to say "which", viz.:

- Which (of two nouns) is more...

> Which is tastier, sushi or cucumber?
> すしときゅうりとどちらおいしいですか？

- Which (of two actions) is more...

> Which is harder, going to school or going to work?
> 学校に行きますのと仕事に行きますとどちらむずかしいですか？

- Which of all (things) is most...

> すしと天ぷらとラーメンとの中で、どれが美味しいですか？
> Which is tastier, sushi, tempura, or ramen?

> 漫画の中で、どれがいいですか？
> Which is the best manga (of all)?

#### Context
These are all fundamental forms, used for basic things (e.g., the forms of "which", whose significance is self-explanatory), and/or for generating yet further inflections (as is the case with the て-form, which we will meet repeatedly).

In Unit 4, we will revisit the ても-form in the context of permission (i.e., "can/may I..."); negative requests (i.e., "please do not do..."); and the negative of ても-form (i.e., "even if not...").

Additional "miscellaneous" topics to expect in Unit 4 include:
- Time Expressions
  - Intervals with 時間
  - Telling Time
  - Dates, Months & Years
  -
